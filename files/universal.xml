		<prayers>
			<The_Hammer_of_Sigmar>
				<diff>7</diff>
				<rule>With a successful prayer, the priest gains +2 strength, and always causes double wounds. The effects do not disappear automatically; instead he has to test each shooting phase to maintain it, giving him an opportunity to say other prayers in addition. This can turn your priest into a true slayer.</rule>
			</The_Hammer_of_Sigmar>
			<Hearts_of_Steel>
				<diff>8</diff>
				<rule>Should be cast early in the battle, before other spells become more urgent. The effects will last while the priest remains standing. All allies within 8" become immune to fear and all-alone tests, and your leader gets a nice +1 to rout-tests.</rule>
			</Hearts_of_Steel>
			<Soulfire>
				<diff>9</diff>
				<rule>From the mouth of a priest, soulfire can be truly devastating to their arch-enemies: cult of the possessed and undead. All within 4" suffer a strength 5 hit without armour saves! Any other kind of enemies will suffer only a strength 3 hit. But unfortunately, this prayer is not easily answered!</rule>
			</Soulfire>
			<Shield_of_Faith>
				<Diff>6</Diff>
				<rule>Grants your priest immunity to all spells. Each recovery phase there is a 1 in 3 chance it will dissolve.</rule>
			</Shield_of_Faith>
			<Healing_Hand>
				<diff>5</diff>
				<rule>Completely heals all your battle-brothers within 2"; those who are stunned or knocked down will get back on their feet instantly! The low difficulty makes it very desirable to learn this prayer, especially as your warriors gain more wounds.</rule>
			</Healing_Hand>
			<Armour_of_Righteousness>
				<diff>9</diff>
				<rule>The boon granted by this prayer is a 2+ save for a full turn, making you priest near invulnerable! Too bad it is quite difficult to cast, and it doesn't last, so it cannot be combined with other non-lasting prayers.</rule>
